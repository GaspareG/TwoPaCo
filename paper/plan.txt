1. Intro
	-Paragraph about de Bruijn graphs in general
	-Paragraph about de Bruijn graphs in comparative genomics
	-Paragraph aobut limitations of approaches
	-Paragraph about the algorithm and its advantages

4. Discussion
	-The algorithm works well and have the following advantages
	-Cool feature: partially compacted graphs
	-It is better than competitors
	-Limitations: based on BF that are not cache friendly :(
	-Difference between assembly and pan-genome
	-Main take-home message: de Bruijn graph for pan-genome are easy to construct, and can form the backbone of sequence genome comparison:
reference/variant representation, alignment and synteny blocks construction



Exp design:

1) The same from CpM paper, except:
	-Add Sibelia and BCALM
	-Add 100 simulated human genomes
	-Add primates dataset
	-Add our tool (two times): 1 thread & 30 threads, BF = input size
2) Scalability: fix a dataset and BF size, run for 2, 4, 8, ... threads, show off scalability
3) Time-memory tradeoff: fix a dataset, run with different BF size, show FP rate and scalability
