0) Refactor: BF -- into a class
1.2) Implement FP removal
1.1) Profile to see the heaviest parts
4) Put in a BF only things that are necessary: if we already have ACT G and ACT C, it doesn't make sense to put there ACT T
3) Implement iterative filtering? Once bif candidates are discovered (set $B$), place in a BF only (k + 1)-mers associated with $B$
