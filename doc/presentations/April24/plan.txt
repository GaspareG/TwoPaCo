Rearrangements:
-- What are they?
-- What are causes?
-- Random breakage vs. breakpoint reuse
-- How to explain non-randomness?
The hypothesis: the longer the intergene, the more (linearly) rearrangements
-- Reconstruct and annotate the anscetral genome
-- Identify breakpoints in successors
-- Gene regions are almost free of rearrangements
-- Concentrate on intergene regions
-- Test hyptohesis: build a regression model
-- Surprise: power law instead of a linear one
What's the explanation?
-- Is GC content the explanation? Nope
-- Is conserved non-coding elements the explanation? Quite a little bit, but not much...
Most rearrangements are inversions in intergenes? 
-- Check by simulation
-- Distributions of inversion lengths are unknown...
-- Use 3D structure as a proxy
-- No explanation
The model based on chromatin closeness explains most...
